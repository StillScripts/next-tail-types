This is a starter site based on [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) that enables using TailwindCSS and TypeScript with  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the local server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

And enjoy styling with Tailwind and coding with TypeScript. This combination is powerful and one of the most productive and fun ways to build web applications!
